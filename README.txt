In this repository, we delve into the analysis of a renowned dataset referred to as "The butterfly dataset." Leveraging the potential of computational methods, we employ both the classic "Hard C-Mean (HCM) clustering algorithm" and the more sophisticated "Fuzzy Bezdek's Hard C-Mean (FBCM) clustering algorithm" to delineate distinct clusters within the dataset. By applying these clustering techniques, we aim to unveil underlying patterns and relationships among the dataset's records, shedding light on its inherent structure and facilitating insights into the nature of the phenomena captured within the dataset. Through meticulous analysis and exploration, we endeavor to extract meaningful information and contribute to the broader understanding of the dataset's characteristics and implications.
